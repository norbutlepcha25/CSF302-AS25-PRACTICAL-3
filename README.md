# CSF302-AS25-PRACTICAL-3 Greedy Algorithm
**Q1 . Huffman Coding for Text Compression**

Implement Huffman Coding for efficient text compression by assigning shorter binary codes to frequent characters.

Given a string A encode the text and compress the size of the text. 

Instruction
1. Input a text string.
2. Calculate the frequency of each character.
3. build a huffman tree and compress the string.
4. Display Frequency table of characters.
5. Generated Huffman codes for each character.
6. Encoded binary string.
7. comprare the size of the original string and the compressed string

**Q2. Fractional Knapsack Algorithm**

Maximize the total value of items in a knapsack with limited capacity using the **greedy approach**.

Give a capacity of the knapsack [K] and a list of items with values V[i] and weight W[i]. Using the Fractional Knapsack Algorithm, find the maximum value of items that can be put in the knapsack.

Instructions
1. Input List of items with their **values V[i]** and **weights W[i]** and Total knapsack capacity K.
2. Add items to the knapsack until full:
3. Calculate the total value obtained.
4. Display Table showing items, weight, value, and ratio.
5. Display Items included (fully or partially).
6. Maximum total value obtained.
